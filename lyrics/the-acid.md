The Acid

<pre>
Easy, easy
To lead me, to kill me
A desire, for you to
Not set myself on fire

It’s easy
To mess with me
To kill me
As I die, gondolas¹
As you set my lungs on fire

Fills my lungs with acid²
My lungs with
Kills me with acid
It kills me

I want to revolution

Burns me through my lungs
Acid burns me through my lungs
Gas burns me

It’s easy to kill me
You should give our lives another chance

Let go of your theory
Of our suppress
Our suppression

And you set our lives on fire
You set our lives on fire

Burns me through my lungs
Acid burns me
Burns me through my lungs
Acid burns me
Burns me through my lungs
Acid burns me through my lungs
Acid burns me through my lungs

## Footnotes

¹ A “gondola” in this context refers to the large, basket-like structure pigs are herded into, which are then lowered into a stunning chamber for gassing before being bled to death. [What are the animal welfare issues associated with different stunning methods for pigs at slaughter?](https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/what-are-the-animal-welfare-issues-associated-with-different-stunning-methods-for-pigs-at-slaughter/), RSPCA Australia

² When combined with O₂ in a pig’s (and human’s) lungs, CO₂ dissolves into carbonic acid. [Wayne Hsung Lecture on Open Rescue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BvPS2vydX4&t=1200s)
