Acid

<pre>
Easy, easy                                      Easy, easy
To lead me, to kill me                          It begs me while I’m sleeping
A desire, for you to                            A desire, second chance
Not set myself on fire                          I have set myself on fire

It’s easy                                       It’s easy
To mess with me                                 Don’t mess with me
To kill me                                      Don’t mess with me
As I die, gondolas¹                             As I die in the flames
As you set my lungs on fire                     As I set myself on fire

                                                Uh
Fills my lungs with acid²                       Wakes me from my sleep
My lungs with                                   Smoke wakes me from
Kills me with acid                              Wakes me from my sleep
It kills me                                     Smoke wakes me from
                                                Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want to revolution                            A one true revolution

Burns me through my lungs                       Wakes me from my sleep
Acid burns me through my lungs                  Smoke wakes me from my sleep
Acid burns me                                   Smoke wakes me

It’s easy to kill me                            It’s easy to leave me
You should give our lives another chance        We should give ourselves another chance

Let go of your belief                           Let go of our troubles
Of our suppress                                 Into our caress
Our suppression                                 Our caress

And you set our lives on fire                   And we set ourselves on fire
You set our lives on fire                       We set ourselves on fire

Burns me through my lungs                       Wakes me from my sleep
Acid burns me                                   Smoke wakes me from
Burns me through my lungs                       Wakes me from my sleep
Acid burns me                                   Smoke wakes me from
Burns me through my lungs                       Wakes me from my sleep
Acid burns me through my lungs                  Smoke wakes me from my sleep
Acid burns me through my lungs                  Smoke wakes me from my sleep
                                                Yeah
