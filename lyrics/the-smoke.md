The Smoke

<pre>
Easy, easy
It begs me while I’m sleeping
A desire, second chance
I have set myself on fire

It’s easy
Don’t mess with me
Don’t mess with me
As I die in the flames
As I set myself on fire

Uh
Wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me from
Wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me from
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A one true revolution

Wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me

It’s easy to leave me
We should give ourselves another chance
Let go of our troubles
Into our caress
Our caress

And we set ourselves on fire
We set ourselves on fire

Wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me from
Wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me from
Wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me from my sleep
Smoke wakes me from my sleep
Yeah
